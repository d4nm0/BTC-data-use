# RSI descprition

The RSI shows the strength, the speed of the market in a sense.

When the RSI is high, it shows that the upside slowdown may be near and the market may come back down.

It's like a rock you throw in the air. The more it goes up, the more the speed decreases, the less it goes up quickly, but it always goes up. When the speed is at zero, the stone will fall.

A high RSI just tells you that the stone is likely to rise less and less quickly, not that it will necessarily fall.
